1. Simon Says: in the first Simon Says game, i used only html, CSS, and javascript to make the game interactive. i used AI to make the comments for this code and to convert the units like px and other nonresponsive units to responsive units ,
Known errors: The game is a little bit slow, which makes it less fun. I have tried to reduce the time, but then it makes this memory-based game super hard to play.

2. design : used only HTML and css to replicate the pdf into website.
3. known errors : the website is reponsible for mobile and the full page but for any middle dimension it gets a little different.
4. used my pic intead of the original one.
